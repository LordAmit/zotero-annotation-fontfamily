Created with the help of LLMs. It works, somehow. Use at own risk. Contains lots of unnecessary code since this is based on the Zotero Plugin Template. I do not know how these work, so I did not remove them as much as I should.

## What it does

In Zotero, there are no settings to change the font of annotations on PDFs. Installing this plugin adds a new configuration option that can be accessed from the *config editor* `extensions.zotero.fontstyle.annotationFontFamily`.

You can type in the font name, and it will be applied. By default, it is set to *Shantell Sans*.
